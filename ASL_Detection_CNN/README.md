# ASL Detection with Computer Vision and a CNN
The goal of the model is to use CV and a 3-layer (this may increase or decrese) CNN to successfully identify all 26 letters of the English alphabet from real time video capture. A user will be able to show their computer's webcam any letter, as well as a *space,* *delete,*–or simply nothing in view–and the model will be able to output the corresponding symbol to the terminal. 

The training and testing data come from the [ASL Alphabet](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grassknoted/asl-alphabet) dataset on Kaggle.

## Goal Checklist
[ ] Successfully run the model locally
[ ] Deploy model on DataBricks
[ ] Convert the model to a TensorFlow Lite model
